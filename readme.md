Accessibility:

    This project establishes a platform for users with disabilities to test and
    critique a websites' accessibility and user friendliness.
	When designing websites and applications, user accessibility is not always
	given the priority it deserves, especially when it comes to those who have
	certain physical challenges. Even when user accessibility is implemented, 
	there is a real need for user feedback to assure that the implementation 
	will actually function as intended. This creates a need for the services of 
	those who face these challenges, which in turn creates the chance for users 
	to receive compensation for their feedback. 

	Our team hopes that our implementation will provide a platform for creators 
	to receive feedback from their users, as well as providing an opportunity 
	for users to have their voices and opinions heard, as well as providing an 
	additional stream of income for users.

Built With

	- Express web framework.
	- MongoDB, to store our users and company information.
	- MediaRecorder API, for screen recording.
	- Cloudinary API, for cloud storage and recording playback.

Todo:

	We have plans to implement the addition of webcam recording, to allow 
	further input  from the users. We also intend to further refine the site UI/
	UX eperience, in order to provide a smooth and accessible website for bother 
	users and creators.
